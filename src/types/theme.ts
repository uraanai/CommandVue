/**
 * Theme types.
 *
 * A `Theme` is a named bundle of CSS-variable overrides applied to the
 * document root at runtime. Built-in themes ship as JSON files under
 * `src/assets/themes/`; custom themes (Prompt 4) live in IndexedDB via
 * `themeRepo` and are registered into `themeRegistry` at boot.
 *
 * Pairing convention: themes that come in light + dark pairs share a base id
 * with a `-light` / `-dark` suffix (e.g. `compact-light` and `compact-dark`)
 * for built-ins, or point at each other via `generation.paired` for
 * generated themes. The Light / Dark / Auto toggle uses either signal to
 * bridge between variants without losing the chosen aesthetic.
 *
 * Tokens layered into the document live in three categories — color, density,
 * and component. Themes **only** override semantic + component tokens.
 * Primitive scales (`--color-slate-500`, `--space-4`, etc.) are off-limits;
 * `docs/design-tokens.md` covers the rationale.
