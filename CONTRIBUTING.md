# Contributing to CommandVue

Thanks for your interest. CommandVue is a **template repository** — its job is to give downstream teams a clean, opinionated, batteries-included starting point for operations dashboards: command-and-control, fleet monitoring, geospatial operations, mission planning, and real-time telemetry. We accept contributions that improve the template itself (better defaults, missing wiring, doc clarity, dependency bumps, accessibility fixes). We do not accept product-specific features.

## Quick start for contributors

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uraanai/CommandVue.git
cd CommandVue
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Required: Node ≥ 22.12, pnpm 10.x.

## Quality gates

Before opening a PR, all of these must pass:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
pnpm test
pnpm spell
pnpm build
pnpm docs:build    # ~3s; catches broken sidebar entries and dead links
```

CI runs them automatically on every PR. The `pnpm spell` step uses the dictionaries under `dictionaries/`. If you introduce a new term, add it to the appropriate dictionary file rather than to `cspell.json`.

### Adding a documentation page

The `docs/` tree is published as a VitePress site (`pnpm docs:dev` for a live preview). When you add a new page:

1. Create the `.md` file under `docs/`.
2. Register it in the sidebar at [`docs/.vitepress/config.ts`](./docs/.vitepress/config.ts) so it appears in the nav.
3. Cross-link from any related page that already exists.
4. Run `pnpm docs:build` to verify the link graph.

## Commit conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced by `@commitlint/config-conventional` via the `commit-msg` Husky hook:

- `feat:` a new feature
- `fix:` a bug fix
- `chore:` tooling / housekeeping
- `docs:` documentation only
- `refactor:` code change with no functional difference
- `test:` test-only change
- `build:` build system or external dependencies
- `ci:` CI configuration
- `perf:` performance improvement
- `style:` formatting only

Example: `feat(panels): add markdown briefing panel`.

## Branch strategy

CommandVue uses a GitFlow-style workflow:

| Branch                                               | Purpose                                             | Receives PRs from            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `main`                                               | Protected. Release-only. Tagged versions live here. | `develop` (release PRs only) |
| `develop`                                            | Long-lived integration branch. Day-to-day target.   | Feature branches             |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `refactor/*`, `chore/*` | Short-lived work branches                           | (branch off `develop`)       |

### Day-to-day workflow

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# do work, commit using Conventional Commits

git push -u origin feat/my-feature
gh pr create --base develop --title "feat: my feature" --body "..."
```

After review and CI green, merge to `develop`. The branch auto-deletes after merge.

### Release workflow

When `develop` is stable and ready to ship:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
gh pr create --base main --title "release: <version>" --body "<changelog summary>"
# After merge:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v<version> -m "<release notes>"
git push origin v<version>
```

### Branch protection summary

- **`main`**: requires CI (`Lint · Type-check · Test · Build`) and `CSpell` passing, linear history, `enforce_admins: true`, no force-push, no deletion, conversation resolution required. Squash-merge only.
- **`develop`**: requires the same status checks passing, no force-push, no deletion. Merge commits allowed (preserves PR boundaries during integration).
- Self-merge is permitted on both branches because the project currently has one active maintainer. Reviewer discipline is by convention.

## Coding rules

The full project guidelines live in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — read that first. Highlights:

- **No `any` types.** Use proper generics or `unknown` + narrowing.
- **No `console.log` in committed code.** Use the logger utility if needed.
- **All composables clean up on unmount.** No leaked listeners, no leaked viewers.
- **Cesium/MapLibre instances live in `shallowRef`, never reactive state.**
- **Pinia stores hold serializable state only** — no DOM refs, no Cesium objects.
- **Tailwind utilities for layout/spacing** — no scoped styles for these concerns.
- **Tokens in `src/assets/styles/tokens.css`** — do not hardcode hex values in components.

## Terminology guidance

CommandVue is a civilian-friendly operations-dashboard template. Keep user-facing copy (docs, comments, README, panel labels) neutral and operations-focused. The active phrasing is:

- "operations" / "mission-critical" / "command-and-control" — preferred descriptors
- "operator" — preferred over military-specific roles
- "operational symbology" — for milsymbol/SIDC rendering
- "assets" — preferred over hardware-specific terms
- "operational environment" — preferred over field-specific terms

Standards names (MIL-STD-2525, APP-6, MGRS, UTM) and library names (milsymbol, @orbat-mapper/convert-symbology) are technical references and may appear unchanged. They are noted in `dictionaries/operations.txt`.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Use the GitHub issue templates under [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). Include repro steps, expected vs actual behavior, and the output of `pnpm --version && node --version`.

## Security

Do not file security issues on the public tracker. See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the reporting address and our handling commitment.
