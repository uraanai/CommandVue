# Documentation sync workflow

This file is the **canonical reference for cross-file consistency** in CommandVue. Whenever an AI agent (or human contributor) makes a change to the codebase, this table tells you what else needs to be updated **in the same PR** so the docs, AI instructions, and runtime configuration never drift out of step.

> Read this **before** you start a non-trivial change, not after. It's much cheaper to update three files in one PR than to chase doc drift across four reviewers.

---

## How to use

1. Identify what your change is (left column of the table below).
2. Apply every update listed in the right column **in the same commit / PR**.
3. If your change matches multiple rows, apply them all.
4. If your change doesn't appear here and you think it's load-bearing, **add a new row in this PR** before merging. Future agents read this file, not your commit message.

The "Quality gates" in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#quality-gates) catch broken sidebar links and missing dictionary terms automatically — but they do **not** catch doc-staleness. That's what this file is for.

## Triggers and required updates

### Library integration (read this first)

> **MANDATORY:** Before writing, modifying, or debugging any code that integrates a third-party library, framework, SDK, CLI tool, or cloud service, **fetch current documentation via the Context7 MCP server**. Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find the right package, then `mcp__context7__query-docs`. **Never** rely on training-data knowledge or a blog post older than ~6 months — the 2026-05-20 Cesium-on-Vite session wedged for hours because we anchored on a stale blog and didn't notice that `vite-plugin-static-copy@4`'s dev middleware had regressed.

| Trigger                                                                                                   | Required action                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adding a new dependency that needs **build/runtime configuration** (Cesium, MapLibre, Vite plugins, etc.) | Pull current docs via Context7 **before** editing `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.*`, or the library's runtime init. Quote the relevant section in the PR description.              |
| **Bumping a major version** of any package with non-trivial config or runtime API                         | Pull docs for the **target** version (not just the changelog) via Context7. Confirm the public API our code uses still matches.                                                 |
| Runtime error names a library (e.g. `cesium.js:...`, `[ECharts]`, `<Lucide Icon>`)                        | Pull that library's current docs via Context7 before guessing at the fix. Library packaging breaks (CJS↔ESM, peer-dep changes, factory-method rewrites) are the usual culprits. |
| User shares a tutorial / blog link older than ~6 months                                                   | Use it as orientation, but cross-check the current Context7 docs before applying any config from it.                                                                            |

**Do not** call Context7 for refactoring our own code, writing scripts from scratch, debugging business logic, general programming concepts, or anything that doesn't involve a specific named library.

### Code & dependency changes

| Trigger                                                   | Update these                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add / rename / remove a **`pnpm` script**                 | `README.md` Scripts table; `CONTRIBUTING.md` Quality gates (if it's CI-relevant)                                                     |
| Add a **runtime dependency** (anything in `dependencies`) | `README.md` Stack table; `CLAUDE.md` Locked technology stack table                                                                   |

| Add a **devDependency**                                   | Update tooling docs only if user-facing (e.g., a new linter, formatter, test framework). Internal-only bumps don't need doc updates. |
| Add a **new environment variable**                        | `README.md` Configuration table; `.env.example`; `docs/deployment.md` Environment variables table                                    |
| Add a **new keyboard shortcut**                           | `src/modules/shortcuts/catalog.ts`; the catalog drives the help dialog automatically — no separate doc page to update                |
| Add a **new pnpm script**                                 | `README.md` Scripts table; `CLAUDE.md` if the script affects an agent workflow                                                       |
| Bump **Node** or **pnpm** minimum                         | `package.json` `engines`; `.nvmrc`; `README.md` Requirements; `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Required:" line; CI workflow matrix                 |

### Feature additions

| **New tool** (measure / draw / select / custom) | Implement under `src/modules/tools/`; export in `src/modules/tools/index.ts` (`TOOLS` array); register a shortcut in `src/modules/shortcuts/catalog.ts`; document in `docs/tools.md` (worked example); add a TitleBar toggle button if you want chrome UI for it                                       |
| **New composable**                              | Add under `src/composables/`; follow the lifecycle contract (init in `mount`, teardown in `onBeforeUnmount`); document in the relevant `docs/*.md` if user-facing                                                                                                                                      |
| **New Pinia store**                             | Add under `src/stores/`; one concern per store; re-export from `src/stores/index.ts`; document in `docs/state.md` if non-trivial                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **New realtime message type**                   | Document in `docs/realtime.md`; ensure the envelope shape matches `WsMessage<T>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **New icon**                                    | Use the right pack per `CLAUDE.md` Icon usage rules; named imports only — never `import *`                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Documentation site

| Add a **new `docs/*.md` page**                                | Register in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` sidebar (under the right section); cross-link from any related existing page; run `pnpm docs:build` to verify |
| **Rename** a `docs/*.md` page                                 | Update the sidebar entry; search the repo for the old filename to fix incoming links (`README.md`, other `docs/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)                    |
| **Remove** a `docs/*.md` page                                 | Remove from sidebar; remove all incoming links                                                                                                        |
| Change the **landing page** (`docs/index.md`) hero / features | Keep the README "Why CommandVue" section consistent with the landing-page hero — they should read as written by the same person                       |

### Tooling / configuration

| New **CSpell-flagged word**      | Add to `dictionaries/operations.txt` / `project.txt` / `tech.txt` (pick the category that matches); **never** to `cspell.json` |
| New **ESLint rule override**     | Document the rationale inline in `eslint.config.ts` (one-line comment); no separate doc page                                   |
| New **Tailwind plugin or token** | Update `docs/styling.md` if user-facing; update `docs/theming.md` if it affects theming                                        |
| New **CI workflow** step         | Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` Quality gates if contributors need to run it locally                                                  |
| New **Husky hook**               | Document in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; explain how to bypass safely if there's a legitimate need                                       |

### Agent memory (claude-mem + `memory/*.md`)

Two memory surfaces; pick the right one per trigger. See the "Memory & knowledge" section in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for the full decision rule.

| Trigger                                                                                                             | Update these                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **New hard rule that must always apply** (e.g., "never bump package X", "always run Y after Z")                     | Create a new `.md` under `~/.claude/projects/D--Work-UraanAI-Public-CommandVue/memory/`; add a link to `MEMORY.md`; use `[[name]]` cross-links to siblings                                                          |
| **Discovered a bug-fix recipe, library gotcha, or "we tried X and reverted" insight**                               | Already captured automatically by claude-mem's `PostToolUse` / `PreToolUse:Read` hooks. No manual write needed in worker runtime (`memory_add` is server-beta only). Just keep working — observations flow through. |
| **Major project change that should be reflected in the searchable corpus** (new panel, big refactor, new module)    | Run `rebuild_corpus({ name: "commandvue" })` once the change lands so the primed knowledge agent sees it.                                                                                                           |
| **A `memory/*.md` rule becomes stale** (the underlying constraint changed, e.g., a held-back package was un-pinned) | Edit or delete the `.md` file; update `MEMORY.md` index; remove inbound `[[name]]` links from sibling files                                                                                                         |
| **You wrote a rule into a session and want it to outlive the session**                                              | Promote it to a `memory/*.md` file — observations decay in relevance over time; MD files are the durable surface                                                                                                    |

### Lifecycle events

> **CHANGELOG policy:** `CHANGELOG.md` is **release-only**. Do not modify it on bug-fix, feature, breaking-change, or deprecation PRs. The entry is written **once, at release time**, as a curated summary of everything since the last tag. The `[Unreleased]` section is a placeholder — leave it empty between releases. See "Cut a release" below for the only row that touches the file.

| **Bug fix** that's internal-only (e.g., test harness, dev-tooling)                             | No doc updates required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Breaking change** (anything in `src/composables/`, `src/modules/`, `src/stores/` public API) | Update affected `docs/*.md`. Lead the PR title with `feat!:` / `fix!:` (or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) so the next release walk catches it. **No `CHANGELOG.md` edit.**                                                                                                |

## Anti-patterns

Things this workflow exists to **prevent**:

- **Stealth additions.** "Just dropping a new script in `package.json`" — the README scripts table will silently rot until someone notices. Sync it in the same commit.
- **Doc-only refactors that diverge from code.** Renaming a function in `src/` without grepping `docs/` for references leaves the docs lying. Always grep.
- **Per-PR CHANGELOG drafts.** The CHANGELOG is **release-only and summary-style** — never write to `[Unreleased]` from a feature / fix / breaking-change PR. The release walk reads `git log` and the PR descriptions; that's the source material. Leaving the file alone between releases keeps it clean and prevents stale half-entries.
- **Adding a new dependency without updating the stack table.** The stack table is a hard contract — `CLAUDE.md` instructs future agents to "not substitute libraries from this list without explicit instruction." If you add one without updating the table, the next agent doesn't know it's locked in.
- **Inventing a new doc trigger without recording it here.** If you find yourself updating three files for the same change repeatedly, that's a missing row in this table.

## When this file itself changes

If you add a row to the table above, that's the same commit as the change that triggered the need for it. Don't open a separate PR.

If you remove a row (e.g., we deleted the `docker:*` scripts), remove the row in the same PR as the deletion.

This file is a living contract. It only works if it stays accurate.
